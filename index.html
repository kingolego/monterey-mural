        <h2 hidden><span data-nosnippet>Synopsis</span></h2>
        <p>This colorful tile mural, chronicling the history of Monterey, California, was created by 
          <a title="GranizoArt.com" rel="noopener nofollow"
             href="https://www.granizoart.com">Guillermo (Bill) Wagner Granizo</a>.
          Commissioned by the community,
          the panoramic mural is <span title="COVID-19 friendly!">displayed outdoors</span>
          on the west wall of the
          <a title="located at the Monterey Conference Center" rel="noopener nofollow"
             href="https://www.montereyconferencecenter.com">Monterey Conference Center</a>
          along Pacific Street
          and features dozens of scenes illustrating the history of 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_California">(Alta) California</a>
          and it's first capital.
        </p>
        <p>The California muralist Granizo displays a dazzling palette of colors
          and equally impressive knowledge of local history,
          which marches chronologically from left to right for 48 feet (14.5 meters).
          From the <span title="Happy Birthday, Monterey!">founding of Monterey in 1770</span>
          by Portolá and Serra to the Gold Rush,
          the mural captures major events and movers/shakers
          from the Spanish, Mexican and early American eras.
          The 20th Century scenes are populated with the likes of Crosby, Morse and Steinbeck
          and <em>all</em> the Monterey area is known to offer, at least up until the Mural's 
          <a href="https://kingolego.github.io/monterey-mural/monterey-herald/applause-greets-new-monterey-mural-1984-03-28.html" >
            unveiling by the City of Monterey</a>
          in 1984!
        </p>
        <p>Thirty years later &mdash; while the Conference Center was being renovated &mdash;
          the tiles were restored and then
          <a title="Monterey Herald" rel="noopener nofollow"
            href="https://www.montereyherald.com/2018/10/16/monterey-conference-center-gets-back-its-historical-mural/">

            the northeast corner of Del Monte Avenue &amp; Pacific Street</a>
          in downtown Monterey.
          Now at ground-level, the sweeping detail of Granizo's genius can be enjoyed by everyone.

          &ldquo;The Monterey Mural is a stupendous work...a

          some deliberately by the artist.
          <em>Spend time with the Mural.</em>
          Let it tell you its story, which is our story.

      <section id="chronology">
        <h2><cite>The Mural</cite> Chronology</h2>
        <p>Granizo had keen personal and professional interests in the history of California.
          Born in San Francisco, he and his family lived in multiple countries,
          learned multiple languages and was exposed to many cultures.
          He lived his entire adult life around the Monterey and San Francisco Bays.
          He clearly saw an opportunity to illustrate the history of both the region and the state
          using Monterey, the provincial capital, as his canvas.
        </p>
        <p>Like the rest of the &ldquo;New World&rdquo;,
          (Atla or Upper) California's history is marked by waves of exploration and migration;
          but colonization was undertaken centuries later here than on the Atlantic coasts of the Americas,
          primarily due to the long distances from Europe across forbidding terrains and seas.
          From the European point-of-view during the golden Age of Sail,
          the North American Pacific coast was one of the most distant places on Earth
          &mdash; a voyage that could last an entire year.
        </p>
        <p>Moving from left-to-right, the <cite>Mural</cite> can be decomposed into three successive acts or eras,
          providing historical context for the many subjects and scenes Granizo portrayed on his tapestry
          and aiding in their interpretation and commentary.
          An attempt at organizing and cataloguing the mural's massive menagerie can be found
          <a title="Catalog of Subjects" href="https://kingolego.github.io/monterey-mural/catalog.html">here</a>.
          These three eras aim to trace the contours of Granizo's composition,
          highlighting the settlement of northwestern <em>Nueva España</em>
          and the acquisition by and development in the United States.
        </p>
        
        <h3>I. <em>Entrada</em></h3>
        <p cite="http://nahc.ca.gov/resources/california-indian-history/">
            Spain's </em>entrada</em> or entry into Alta California was a last gasp
            from its already over-extended empire in the New World.
            While the missions were being established in Alta California,
            the United States was fighting for its independence from England.
            Mexico completed its own war of independence from Spain in 1821,
            only a half-century after the founding of Monterey.
            The
            <a title="Native American Heritage Commission" rel="noopener nofollow"
              href="http://nahc.ca.gov/resources/california-indian-history/">California Indians</a>
            and other first peoples of the Pacific coast
            developed diverse, rich cultures over many millenia,
            but were overwhelmed by the Europeans' &ldquo;guns, germs and steel.&rdquo;
            The California indigenous populations collapsed in the first century of colonization;
            while difficult to establish and still debated, probably by a factor of 10.
          </p>
          <p>In the first third of the mural, Granizo frames a large roundhouse,
            a tribe's cultural centerpiece,
            with an explorers' ship and longboat, on the left and top, respectively.
            To the right of his tableaux of Indian life,
            Granizo reenacts the &ldquo;Founding of Monterey&rdquo;
            and presents the Royal Presidio Chapel,
            the historic anchor of the original Monterey Presidio.
            Granizo memorializes the tragic fate of thousands upon thousands
            with a Christian burial in front of the Chapel
            and writes his longest text on the explorer's jib, in Spanish: 
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <em>Estos caballeros fueron los precursores de un nuevo dios, una nueva cultura,
              un nuevo lengua y el fin del paraíso aborigen.</em>
            [Translated: These knights were the heralds of a new god, a new culture,
            a new tongue and the end of an aboriginal paradise.]
          </blockquote>
        
        <h3>II. <span class="nowrap">&ldquo;Years before the Mast&rdquo;</span>
          in the <span class="nowrap">Age of Sail</span></h3>
          <p>As Columbus first learned, establishing a New World colony is not the same as keeping one.
            While Monterey was deliberately founded on the return leg of Spain's Manila gold trade,
            this infrequent, but critical, economic support for the Spanish empire was already in decline.
            Indian rebellions along the de Anza trail and Mexico's decade-long fight for independence
            also weakened the young colony's long supply lines.
          </p>
          <p>Dominating the mural's left-of-center is a huge wooden ship or galleon
            unloading its <span title="(not gold on the return route!)">precious cargo</span>;
            the fugacious Mission (or Spanish) and Rancho (or Mexican) periods end to the left of the galleon
            and the American period(s) begin on the right.
            The galleon itself features a tile-mural-within-a-mural on its stern;
            in the bottom-right tableaux there, Granizo drew a 49er,
            the quintessential, mythos-making, California gold seeker.
          </p>
          <p>Granizo's galleon may represent (at least) three concrete or conceptual ships:
            the Manila galleons themselves,
            Bouchard's <cite>La Argentina</cite> from the &ldquo;Battle of Monterey&rdquo;
            &mdash; Granizo shows cannons being fired from the quarterdeck (!),
            and the traffic generated by Mexico's liberalized trade policies
            &mdash; leading to Monterey's Custom House and the text along the waterline:
            &ldquo;came other ships from many lands[,] steam and iron were in their cargo.&rdquo;
          </p>
        
        <h3>III. The American Centuries</h3>
          <p>After the rapid and largely peaceful occupation,
            conquest and acquisition of California by the United States,
            suddenly &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; is a yell heard 'round the world.
            The boom-and-bust cycle of the world's fifth-largest economy
            is firmly established by the Gold Rush.
            California's resources attract diverse immigrants,
            but Yankee dominance kindles native massacres and dispossession of the Californios and others.
          </p>
          <p>Between losing claim to the capital and the Gold Rush,
            Monterey's population drops and its historic adobes empty.
            (The upper-third of the mural in this section is even less populated that the others.)
            Granizo placed Colton Hall in the center of a set of now-well-preserved 19th Century buildings,
            where he wrote &ldquo;as the pueblo grew, a new era evolved&rdquo;.
          </p>
          <p>The second half of the 19th century quickly gives way to the 20th,
            where Granizo fills the final third of the mural,
            [re]marking on the side of the Sloat Monument (perhaps resuming the previous text):
            &ldquo;[...]fishermen, cattlemen, educators, authors, artists [and] vendors flourished.&rdquo;
            Granizo returns to Monterey's waterfront with a crowded diorama of Fisherman's Wharf
            and the harbor in the foreground,
            with water sports and other leisures backed by Cannery Row.
          </p>
        
          <p>Granizo certainly succeeds in capturing the important role of Monterey in California,
            providing a vibrant, tangible record of our history
            &mdash; an expansive view of what has been
            and continues to be one of the most visually stunning
            and engaging parts of our Pacific coast.
            Whether you are just downtown in Monterey or planning a trip on or near the

        <h2>About <em>maestro</em> Granizo</h2>
        <p>Christened <em>William Joseph Wagner</em>, Granizo was born in San Francisco on March 11, 1923 &mdash;
          the first-born son (but second child) of Dora Granizo and Joseph Wagner, 
          who were Nicaraguan and German, respectively.
          His family moved south to be with his mother's family and to chase his father's dreams of Aztec gold.
          They lived in central America for over a decade,
          returning to San Francisco with Granizo, a 13-year-old teenager speaking Spanish and German,
          but without his older sister, Dorita, who died at the age of 12 of typhoid.
          Granizo would remain influenced by his sister's fanciful stories, Maya stelae
          and the vibrant colors of the native weavings and pottery he experienced as a child.
          He claimed to have used 250 different glazes in the Monterey Mural!

        </figure>
        <p>For all those who admire him and his work,
          Granizo thoughtfully left behind an autobiographical series
          of over 100 small (3-by-3-foot) ceramic tile murals.
          The artist's self-portrait shown here is one of the &ldquo;tile paintings&rdquo; in the series.
          The artist's sons, Ron and Bob (also a muralist),
          posthumously published a catalog of this “life series”,
          including descriptions of the tile paintings written by Granizo himself, as an

            illustrated autobiography</a>
          on Amazon.
        </p>
        <p>While brief, the first person reminiscences and dream explorations are enchanting
          and provide fascinating insights into the maestro's life and work.
          There are a few pages describing major works, like our very own <cite>Monterey Mural</cite>,
          but a more complete, retrospective catalog exploring his legacy is still to be written.
          You can also see the autobiographical series and the mural descriptions on his website,

          He first took up painting as therapy while in hospital,
          recuperating from his wounds and surgeries over 3 years.
          He was discharged from the Army in San Francisco with a pregnant wife,
          a new home and studies at the College of Art
          &mdash; the last two funded by the GI Bill.

          The artist created over 7,000 murals, producing 500 murals/year
          during the height of his career in the 1980s.
          If he didn't have a paying commission, he would still create
          and donate the new work to children's hospitals or give them to friends.
          Most of his work is not as large as LA's <cite>Olympic Fantasy</cite> or <cite>Monterey Mural</cite>,
          ~2200 and ~500 ft&sup2;, respectively, but many are larger than the panels in the life series,

          <p>As it marches through Monterey's history,
            the mural reaches almost 48 feet &mdash; it's 574 inches wide.
            Some sources describe it as 11 feet tall, but it's slightly less than 10 &mdash; 117 inches, exactly.
            The <em>content</em> of the mural is represented on 549 9-by-12-inch terracotta tiles
            &mdash; a format Granizo used in many of his works, including his autobiographical life series.
            The &ldquo;tile canvas&rdquo; includes nine rows of these 9-by-12 tiles,
            which ends up being almost 10 feet tall when you
            include the small tile frame or border that Granizo handcrafted for his masterpiece
            and add the grout between the tiles.
